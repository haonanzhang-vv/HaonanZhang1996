  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The rapid growth of e-commerce has significantly transformed consumer behavior, raising questions about how the adoption of online shopping influences offline shopping. This paper investigates whether consumers who adopt online shopping with a retailer become more price sensitive in their subsequent offline purchases with the same retailer. Using transaction-level data from a large Brazilian pet supplies retailer operating both online and offline channels, we compare “adopters” - customers who began shopping online after a period of offline-only purchasing - with “non-adopters” who remained offline-only. We estimate a discrete choice logit model with individual-level heterogeneity, using a novel algorithm to handle high-dimensional fixed effects and address price endogeneity. We apply a staggered difference-in-differences approach to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). We find that offline price sensitivity increases significantly post-online adoption in three of four product categories, particularly in low-switching-cost items like pet hygiene. Counterfactual pricing simulations show that incorporating these behavioral spillovers into pricing strategies can increase firm profits by up to 4.1\%. These results underscore the importance of recognizing cross-channel effects in consumer behavior and contribute to the literature on pricing and multichannel retailing by identifying online adoption as a key driver of offline price sensitivity.
